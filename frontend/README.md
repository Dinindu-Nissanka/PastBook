# Getting Started with Create React App

I was not able to finish the given front end work. Needed to create a login since I have secured the backend with token authorization.

Able to view the image selector UI by fetching the data directly from the given url. But that is the wrong way and I have implemented the requred endpoints in the backend but could not implement the frontend work.

The project deadline was given as 2 days and it took me a considarable time to work in the backend
